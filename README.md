 📊 Superstore Profitability & Strategic Analysis

 🚀 Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive data science analysis on retail sales data to solve the "High Sales, Low Profit" paradox.
By utilizing Clustering, Regression, and Strategic Matrix Analysis, actionable insights were derived to optimize marketing budget and inventory management.

 📂 Repository Structure & Scripts

The core analysis is divided into 5 specific modules located in the `src/` folder:

 1. `Break-even point.py`
   Goal: Diagnostic analysis of discounting strategy.
   Method: Calculates the exact discount threshold where profitability turns negative.
   Output: Determines that discounts >20% yield negative margins using statistical thresholds.

 2. `clustring.py`
   Goal: Customer Segmentation.
   Method: Applied RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) combined with K-Means Clustering.
   Result: identified 4 distinct customer personas (e.g., "High-Value Loyalists" vs. "Discount Seekers").

 3. `CLV.py`
   Goal: Customer Lifetime Value & Profitability Drivers.
   Method: Analyzes long-term customer value and simulates profit scenarios (Counterfactual Analysis).
   Insight: Proves that optimizing the discount policy for specific segments significantly increases CLV.

 4. `matrix portfilio products.py`
   Goal: Product Performance Analysis.
   Method: Generates the "Kill List" – identifying bottom-performing products that drain resources.
   Visualization: Bar charts highlighting low-margin SKUs.

 5. `BCG and heatmap.py`
   Goal: Executive Dashboard & Strategic Visualization.
   Method:
       BCG Matrix: Maps products to Growth/Share quadrants (Stars, Dogs, Cows).
       Heatmap: Market Basket Analysis to find cross-selling opportunities (Product Affinity).

 🧠 Key Insights

1.  Discount Sensitivity: A generic discount strategy is hurting the bottom line. Tech products have high organic demand and don't require deep discounts.
2.  Customer Behavior: A significant cluster of customers ("Discount Seekers") only purchases loss-making items. Marketing spend on this segment should be cut.
3.  Product Strategy: The "Tables" sub-category is a "Dog" (Low Margin, Low Growth), while "Phones" are "Stars".

  📸 Visual Analytics & Dashboard

Here are the key visual outputs generated by the analysis pipeline. These charts are automatically created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

 1. Strategic Product Portfolio (BCG Matrix)
Goal: Identify "Stars" (High Growth/Profit) vs. "Dogs" (Low Growth/Profit).
 Insight: Technology products (green bubbles) are our primary profit drivers, while Tables (gray bubbles) are draining resources.

 2. Customer Segmentation (Cluster Profiling)
Goal: Visualize the 4 distinct customer personas identified by K-Means.
 Insight: The diagonal plots show the distribution, while scatter plots reveal the clear separation between "Loyalists" (Green) and "Discount Seekers" (Red).

 3. Cross-Selling Opportunities (Market Basket Analysis)
Goal: Discover which product categories are frequently purchased together.
 Insight: Darker squares indicate high co-occurrence. Strong affinity found between "Binders" and "Paper", suggesting a bundling opportunity.

 4. The "Kill List" (Lowest Margin Products)
Goal: Identify the top 10 products negatively impacting the bottom line.
 Action: Immediate price restructuring or discontinuation recommended for these SKUs.

 5. Automated Terminal Report
Goal: A snapshot of the automated CLI report generated after each data pipeline run.
